### Welcome to Sprecher
This is a blog that both I (Curlpipe) and DumbMahreeo will write articles on.

### What will you post?
Mainly technology stuff but all sorts of stuff really.

### What does it use??
I built this blog using Rust.

| Language | Lines of Code |
|----------|---------------|
| Rust     | 118           |
| HTML     | 60            |
| CSS      | 22            |

Here are the things that I used:

- Actix Web - For creating a web server
- Askama - For html templating
- UIKit - For styling
- Comrak - Markdown to HTML conversion

### What are your interests?
We like to discuss and talk about several topics, here they are in order of frequency:

1. Linux
2. Programming
3. Spoken Languages
4. Politics
